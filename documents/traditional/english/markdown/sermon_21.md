## Chapter Twenty-One

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Twenty-One</span>

The Scripture of the Wheel, First:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The Spokes are the eight components of chaos, as yet solidified by the law of time: static change, if you will, something the lizard gods refer to as the Striking. That is the reptile wheel, coiled potential, ever-preamble to the never-action.'</span>

Second:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'They are the lent bones of the Aedra, the Eight gift-limbs to
<span style="color:red">SITHISIT</span>,
the wet earth of the new star our home. Outside them is the Aurbis, and not within. Like most things inexplicable, it is a circle. Circles are confused serpents, striking and striking and never given leave to bite. The Aedra would have you believe different, but they were givers before liars. Lies have turned them into biters. Their teeth are the proselytizers; to convert is to place oneself in the mouth of falsehood; even to propitiate is to be swallowed.'</span>

Third:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The enlightened are those uneaten by the world.'</span>

Fourth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The spaces between the gift-limbs number sixteen, the signal shapes of the Demon Princedoms. It is the key and the lock, series and manticore.'</span>

Fifth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Look at the majesty sideways and all you see is the Tower, which our ancestors made idols from. Look at its center and all you see is the begotten hole, second serpent, womb-ready for the Right Reaching, exact and without enchantment.'</span>

Sixth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The heart of the second serpent holds the secret triangular gate.'</span>

Seventh:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Look at the secret triangular gate sideways and you see the secret Tower.'</span>

Eighth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The secret Tower within the Tower is the shape of the only name of God, I.'</span>

The ending of the words is
<span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span>.
