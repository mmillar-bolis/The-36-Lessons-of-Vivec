## Chapter Nineteen

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Nineteen</span>

Vivec put on his armor and stepped into a non-spatial space filling to capacity with mortal interaction and information, a canvas-less cartography of every single mind it has ever known, an event that had developed some semblance of a divine spark. He said, 'From here I shall launch my attack on the eight monsters.'

Vivec then saw the moths that would come from the starry heart, bringing with them dust more horrible than the ash of Red Mountain. He saw the twin head of a ruling king who had no equivalent. And eight imperfections rubbed into precious stones, set into a crown that looked like shackles, which he understood to be the twin crowns of the two-headed king. And a river that fed into the mouth of the two-headed king, because he contained multitudes.

Vivec then built the Provisional House at the Center of the Secret Door. From here he could watch the age to come. Of the House is written:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Cornerstone one has a finger</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Buried under, pointing through</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Dirt, slow low in the ground</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">North cannot be guessed,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">And yet it is spirit-free</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Cornerstone two has a tongue,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">And even dust can be talkative,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Listen and you will see the love</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">The ancient libraries need</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Cornerstone three has a bit of string,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Shaped like your favorite color,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">A girl remembers who left it there</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">But she is afraid to dig it out,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">And see what it is attached to</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Cornerstone four has nine bones,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Removed carefully from a black cat,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Arranged in the fashion of this word,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Protecting us from our enemies</span>

Your house is safe now

So why is it&mdash;

Your house is safe now

So why is it&mdash;

The ending of the words is
<span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span>.
