## The Thirty-Six Lessons of Vivec: Sermon Seven

1. As the caravan of Nerevar now made for the capital of Veloth, anon Almalexia, there came great rumblings from the oblivion.

2. A duke among scamps wandered into the House of Troubles, pausing before each scripture door to pay his respects, until finally he was met by the major domo of Mehrunes Dagon.

3. The Duke of Scamps said, 'I was summoned by Lord Dagon, master of the foul waters and fire, and I have brought the pennants of my seven legions.'

4. The major domo, whose head was a bubble of foul water and fire, bowed low, so that the head of the Duke of Scamps became enclosed in his own.

5. He saw the first pennant, which commanded a legion of grim warriors who could die at least twice.

6. He saw the second pennant, which commanded a legion of winged bulls and the emperor of color that rode upon each.

7. He saw the third pennant, which commanded a legion of inverted gorgons, great snakes whose scales were the faces of men.

8. He saw the fourth pennant, which commanded a legion of double-crossed lovers.

9. He saw the fifth pennant, which commanded a legion of jumping wounds looking to hop onto a victim.

10. He saw the sixth pennant, which commanded a legion of abridged planets.

11. He saw the seventh pennant, which commanded a legion of armored winning moves.

12. To which the major domo said, 'Duke Kh-Utta, your legions while mighty are not enough to destroy Nerevar or the Triune way. Look upon the Hortator and see the wisdom he takes to wife.'

13. And they looked into the middle world and saw:\
\
Evaporating in a throng of thunder\
Of red war and chitin men,\
Where destines\
Take him further from our ways\
The heat that we have wanted\
And pray they still remember,\
Where destines\
Clothe the distance,\
Glad in the golden east that we saw it now,\
Instead of the war and repair\
Of the oblivious fracture\
A curse on the Hortator\
And two more on his hands

14. And the Duke of Scamps saw the palms of the Hortator, upon which the egg had written these words of power:\
\
GHARTOK PADHOME GHARTOK PADHOME.

15. The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.
