## The Theoretical Whirling School Edition

This is an archive of the verse system invented by the now defunct [Theoretical Whirling School][1]. This format was referred to as the *Numbered Version*, as opposed to the standard format which they referred to as the *Temple Version*. An archive of the entire site is still available on [archive.org][2], however chapters 17 and 22 appear to be missing in the latest backups.

Chapters 1-16, 18-21, and 23-36 are taken from the [2005-02 archive][3], while chapters 17 & 22 are from the [2004-08 archive][4]. Below is the preface from the 2005 reissue.

## Preface

> > Preface by Nigedo
> >
> > With this latest revision of the Numbered Version, I have decided to offer some of my own thoughts as a preface to the Lessons. I hope that these observations will prove useful to you.
>
> There is no verifiable evidence that Vivec actually wrote the Lessons. The Lessons contain a cryptographic message which concludes "Vivec wrote this" (see the section 'Hidden Words'), but that may not literally mean he put quill to parchment himself, to record each sermon.
>
> It is more significant, though, that Vivec has publicly endorsed the Lessons as his own words on many occasions. He boldly reiterated the confession concealed within the Lessons at his trial (see 'The Trial of Vivec') and he prefaced his lesson on The Tower by saying "I have spoken of this in an earlier life", a reference to the parallel teachings in Sermon Twenty-One.
>
> There should be no doubt, therefore, that the Lessons are Vivec's own teachings.
>
> What then is the purpose of the Lessons? Did Vivec intend them merely to obfuscate the origins of the Tribunal, to rewrite historical events and to mask the true nature of his own immortality from the Dunmer?
>
> The very separation of Tribunal Temple lore into Hierographa and Apographa indicates a level of censoreship that Vivec considered to be an important tool of statecraft and theocratic control. But, while there may be no doubt that Vivec thought it beneficial for the majority of Dunmer to be ignorant of his stolen divinity, this does not impact the veracity of the Lessons in anything but the most naive of narrative readings.
>
> Even a casual glance through the Lessons will show that they contain very few obvious references to the origins of the Tribunal and their divinity. These few they do contain are heavily cloaked with symbolism, through which they may in fact offer real insight into the nature of ALMSIVI.
>
> Moreover they openly contradict other portions of the Hierographa that are less esoteric in nature and far more accessible to common Dunmer, such as the 'The Cantatas of Vivec', which describe "the evolution of Vivec from a foolish mortal into an enlightened divine".
>
> I do not believe that the Lessons are intended to be regarded as a literal account of historical events, although they may be taken as such by the unlearned. They are primarily a collection of insights into the mind of, and the experience of being, Vivec.
>
> In some cases, they are allegories which signpost the deeper mysteries of the historical events they illustrate. In others, they are codified instructions for gaining an understanding of the Universe's workings, as seen through the eyes of Vivec.
>
> Read from this perspective, the Lessons become an unparalleled resource, providing knowledge of the world that is many layered and beyond the grasp of untutored mortals. I hope that you will find as much in their messages as I have, and more.
