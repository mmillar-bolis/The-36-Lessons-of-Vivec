## Chapter Twenty-One

__1.__ The Scripture of the Wheel, First:\
\
'The Spokes are the eight components of chaos, as yet solidified by the law of time: static change, if you will, something the lizard gods refer to as the Striking.

__2.__ That is the reptile wheel, coiled potential, ever-preamble to the never-action.'

__3.__ Second:\
\
'They are the lent bones of the Aedra, the Eight gift-limbs to SITHISIT, the wet earth of the new star our home.

__4.__ Outside them is the Aurbis, and not within.

__5.__ Like most things inexplicable, it is a circle. Circles are confused serpents, striking and striking and never given leave to bite.

__6.__ The Aedra would have you believe different, but they were givers before liars. Lies have turned them into biters.

__7.__ Their teeth are the proselytizers; to convert is to place oneself in the mouth of falsehood; even to propitiate is to be swallowed.'

__8.__ Third:\
\
'The enlightened are those uneaten by the world.'

__9.__ Fourth:\
\
'The spaces between the gift-limbs number sixteen, the signal shapes of the Demon Princedoms. It is the key and the lock, series and manticore.'

__10.__ Fifth:\
\
'Look at the majesty sideways and all you see is the Tower, which our ancestors made idols from.

__11.__ Look at its center and all you see is the begotten hole, second serpent, womb-ready for the Right Reaching, exact and without enchantment.'

__12.__ Sixth:\
\
'The heart of the second serpent holds the secret triangular gate.'

__13.__ Seventh:\
\
'Look at the secret triangular gate sideways and you see the secret Tower.'

__14.__ Eighth:\
\
'The secret Tower within the Tower is the shape of the only name of God, I.'

__15.__ The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.
