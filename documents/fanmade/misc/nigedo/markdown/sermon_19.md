## Chapter Nineteen

__1.__ Vivec put on his armor and stepped into a non-spatial space filling to capacity with mortal interaction and information, a canvas-less cartography of every single mind it has ever known, an event that had developed some semblance of a divine spark.\
\
He said, 'From here I shall launch my attack on the eight monsters.'

__2.__ Vivec then saw the moths that would come from the starry heart, bringing with them dust more horrible than the ash of Red Mountain.

__3.__ He saw the twin head of a ruling king who had no equivalent. And eight imperfections rubbed into precious stones, set into a crown that looked like shackles, which he understood to be the twin crowns of the two-headed king. And a river that fed into the mouth of the two-headed king, because he contained multitudes.

__4.__ Vivec then built the Provisional House at the Center of the Secret Door. From here he could watch the age to come.

__5.__ Of the House is written:\
\
Cornerstone one has a finger\
Buried under, pointing through\
Dirt, slow low in the ground\
North cannot be guessed,\
And yet it is spirit-free

__6.__ Cornerstone two has a tongue,\
And even dust can be talkative,\
Listen and you will see the love\
The ancient libraries need

__7.__ Cornerstone three has a bit of string,\
Shaped like your favorite color,\
A girl remembers who left it there\
But she is afraid to dig it out,\
And see what it is attached to

__8.__ Cornerstone four has nine bones,\
Removed carefully from a black cat,\
Arranged in the fashion of this word,\
Protecting us from our enemies

__9.__ Your house is safe now\
\
So why is it--\
\
Your house is safe now\
\
So why is it--

__10.__ The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.
