The Thirty-Six Lessons of Vivec: Sermon Seven<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
As the caravan of Nerevar now made for the capital of Veloth, anon Almalexia, there came great rumblings from the oblivion. A duke among scamps wandered into the House of Troubles, pausing before each scripture door to pay his respects, until finally he was met by the major domo of Mehrunes Dagon.<BR>
<BR>
The Duke of Scamps said, 'I was summoned by Lord Dagon, master of the foul waters and fire, and I have brought the pennants of my seven legions.'<BR>
<BR>
The major domo, whose head was a bubble of foul water and fire, bowed low, so that the head of the Duke of Scamps became enclosed in his own.<BR>
<BR>
He saw the first pennant, which commanded a legion of grim warriors who could die at least twice.<BR>
<BR>
He saw the second pennant, which commanded a legion of winged bulls and the emperor of color that rode upon each.<BR>
<BR>
He saw the third pennant, which commanded a legion of inverted gorgons, great snakes whose scales were the faces of men.<BR>
<BR>
He saw the fourth pennant, which commanded a legion of double-crossed lovers.<BR>
<BR>
He saw the fifth pennant, which commanded a legion of jumping wounds looking to hop onto a victim.<BR>
<BR>
He saw the sixth pennant, which commanded a legion of abridged planets.<BR>
<BR>
He saw the seventh pennant, which commanded a legion of armored winning moves.<BR>
<BR>
To which the major domo said, 'Duke Kh-Utta, your legions while mighty are not enough to destroy Nerevar or the Triune way. Look upon the Hortator and see the wisdom he takes to wife.'<BR>
<BR>
And they looked into the middle world and saw:<BR>
<BR>
Evaporating in a throng of thunder<BR>
Of red war and chitin men,<BR>
Where destines<BR>
Take him further from our ways<BR>
The heat that we have wanted<BR>
And pray they still remember,<BR>
Where destines<BR>
Clothe the distance,<BR>
Glad in the golden east that we saw it now,<BR>
Instead of the war and repair<BR>
Of the oblivious fracture<BR>
A curse on the Hortator<BR>
And two more on his hands<BR>
<BR>
And the Duke of Scamps saw the palms of the Hortator, upon which the egg had written these words of power: GHARTOK PADHOME GHARTOK PADHOME.<BR>
<BR>
The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.<BR>
