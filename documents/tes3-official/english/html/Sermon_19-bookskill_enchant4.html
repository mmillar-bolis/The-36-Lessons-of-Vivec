The Thirty-Six Lessons of Vivec: Sermon Nineteen<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
Vivec put on his armor and stepped into a non-spatial space filling to capacity with mortal interaction and information, a canvas-less cartography of every single mind it has ever known, an event that had developed some semblance of a divine spark. He said, 'From here I shall launch my attack on the eight monsters.'<BR>
<BR>
Vivec then saw the moths that would come from the starry heart, bringing with them dust more horrible than the ash of Red Mountain. He saw the twin head of a ruling king who had no equivalent. And eight imperfections rubbed into precious stones, set into a crown that looked like shackles, which he understood to be the twin crowns of the two-headed king. And a river that fed into the mouth of the two-headed king, because he contained multitudes. <BR>
Vivec then built the Provisional House at the Center of the Secret Door. From here he could watch the age to come. Of the House is written:<BR>
<BR>
Cornerstone one has a finger<BR>
Buried under, pointing through<BR>
Dirt, slow low in the ground<BR>
North cannot be guessed,<BR>
And yet it is spirit-free<BR>
<BR>
Cornerstone two has a tongue,<BR>
And even dust can be talkative,<BR>
Listen and you will see the love<BR>
The ancient libraries need<BR>
<BR>
Cornerstone three has a bit of string,<BR>
Shaped like your favorite color,<BR>
A girl remembers who left it there<BR>
But she is afraid to dig it out,<BR>
And see what it is attached to<BR>
<BR>
Cornerstone four has nine bones,<BR>
Removed carefully from a black cat,<BR>
Arranged in the fashion of this word,<BR>
Protecting us from our enemies<BR>
<BR>
Your house is safe now<BR>
<BR>
So why is it--<BR>
<BR>
Your house is safe now<BR>
<BR>
So why is it--<BR>
<BR>
The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.<BR>
