## <span style="font-family:Daedric">Cahnahn'asca'Shoreshik</span>

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Thirty-Two</span>

<img align="left" width="100" src="../../../assets/fonts/png/red/glyph_t.png">he Scripture of the Mace,

First:

&emsp;&emsp;'The pleasure of annihilation is the pleasure of disappearing into the unreal.
<b>&sup2;</b>All those that would challenge the sleeping world will seek membership in this movement. I denounce the alienation of the Cloven Duality with a hammer.'

<b>&sup3;</b>Second:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Take from me the lessons as a punishment for being mortal. To be made of dirt is to be treated as such by your jailers.
<b>&#8308;</b>This is the key and the lock of the Daedra. Why do you think they escaped the compromise?'</span>

<b>&#8309;</b>Third:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Velothi, your skin has become the pregnant darkness. My brooding has brought this on.
<b>&#8310;</b>Remember that Boethiah asked you to become the color of bruise. How else to show yourselves people of the exodus into the vital: pain?'</span>

<b>&#8311;</b>Fourth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The sage who is not an anvil: a conventional sentence and nothing more. By which I mean dead, the fourth walking way.'</span>

<b>&#8312;</b>Fifth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'A proper comprehension of the virtues: stage-managed and to be murdered.'</span>

<b>&#8313;</b>Sixth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'In the end, rejoice as a hostage released from drumming torment but that savors his wound.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>The drum breaks and you find it to be a nest of hornets, which is to say: your sleep is over.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Seventh:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The suspicious is spectacle and the lie is only a theoretical inspiration.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>Eighth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'But then why, you ask, do the Daedra wish to meddle with the Aurbis? It is because they are the radical critique, essential as all martyrs.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>That some are more evil than others is not an illusion. Or rather, it is a necessary illusion.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>The ending of the words is
<span style="font-family:Daedric;color:red">ASV</span>.
