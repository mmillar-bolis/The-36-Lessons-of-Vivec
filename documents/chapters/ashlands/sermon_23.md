<b>&sup2;</b>Second:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The unity of my approach is understood by the immobile warrior. True eyes are acquired.

<b>&#8308;</b>Third:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Girls burn their dresses on my arrival if I am armored. They crawl to me as bled pilgrims.

<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>Sixth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The span of the apparently inactivated is your love of the absolute. The birth of God from the netchiman's wife is the abortion of kindness from love.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Seventh:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The true sword is able to cut chains of generations, which is to say, the creation myths of your enemies. Look on me as the exiled garden. All else is uncut weed.'</span>
