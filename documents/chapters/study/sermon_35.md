## Chapter Thirty-Five

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Thirty-Five</span>

1. The Scripture of Love:\
\
&emsp;&emsp;'The formulas of proper Velothi magic\
&emsp;&emsp;continue in ancient tradition,\
&emsp;&emsp;but that virility is dead,\
&emsp;&emsp;by which I mean at least replaced.
2. &emsp;&emsp;Truth owes its medicinal nature\
&emsp;&emsp;to the establishment of the myth of justice.
3. &emsp;&emsp;Its curative properties it likewise owes\
&emsp;&emsp;to the concept of sacrifice.\
&emsp;&emsp;Princes, chiefs, and angels\
&emsp;&emsp;all subscribe to the same notion.
4. &emsp;&emsp;This is a view\
&emsp;&emsp;primarily based on a prolific abolition\
&emsp;&emsp;of an implied profanity,\
&emsp;&emsp;seen in ceremonies, knife fighting, hunting,\
&emsp;&emsp;and the exploration of the poetic.

5. &emsp;&emsp;On the ritual of occasions,\
&emsp;&emsp;which comes to us\
&emsp;&emsp;from the days of the cave glow,\
&emsp;&emsp;I can say nothing more\
&emsp;&emsp;than to loosen your equation\
&emsp;&emsp;of moods to lunar currency.
6. &emsp;&emsp;Later, and by that I mean much, much later,\
&emsp;&emsp;my reign will be seen\
&emsp;&emsp;as an act of the highest love,\
&emsp;&emsp;which is a return from the astral destiny\
&emsp;&emsp;and the marriages between.
7. &emsp;&emsp;By that I mean the catastrophes,\
&emsp;&emsp;which will come from all five corners.\
&emsp;&emsp;Subsequent are the revisions,\
&emsp;&emsp;differentiated between hope and the distraught,\
&emsp;&emsp;situations that are only required\
&emsp;&emsp;by the periodic death of the immutable.

8. &emsp;&emsp;Cosmic time is repeated:\
&emsp;&emsp;I wrote of this in an earlier life.\
&emsp;&emsp;An imitation of submersion is love's premonition,\
&emsp;&emsp;its folly into the underworld,\
&emsp;&emsp;by which I mean the day you will read about\
&emsp;&emsp;outside of yourself in an age of gold.
9. &emsp;&emsp;For on that day,\
&emsp;&emsp;which is a shadow of the sacrificial concept,\
&emsp;&emsp;all history is obliged to see me for what you are:\
&emsp;&emsp;in love with evil.
10. &emsp;&emsp;To keep one's powers intact at such a stage\
&emsp;&emsp;is to allow for the existence\
&emsp;&emsp;of what can only be called\
&emsp;&emsp;a continual spirit.

11. &emsp;&emsp;Make of your love a defense against the horizon.\
&emsp;&emsp;Pure existence is only granted to the holy,\
&emsp;&emsp;which comes in a myriad of forms,\
&emsp;&emsp;half of them frightening\
&emsp;&emsp;and the other half divided\
&emsp;&emsp;into equal parts purposeless and assured.
12. &emsp;&emsp;Late is the lover that comes to this\
&emsp;&emsp;by any other walking way than the fifth,\
&emsp;&emsp;which is the number of the limit of this world.

13. &emsp;&emsp;The lover is the highest country\
&emsp;&emsp;and a series of beliefs.\
&emsp;&emsp;He is the sacred city\
&emsp;&emsp;bereft of a double.\
&emsp;&emsp;The uncultivated land\
&emsp;&emsp;of monsters is the rule.
14. &emsp;&emsp;This is clearly attested by
<span style="color:red">ANU</span>
and his double,\
&emsp;&emsp;which love knows never really happened.\
&emsp;&emsp;Similarly, all the other symbols of absolute reality\
&emsp;&emsp;are ancient ideas ready for their graves,\
&emsp;&emsp;or at least the essence of such.
15. &emsp;&emsp;This scripture is directly ordered by the codes of Mephala,\
&emsp;&emsp;the origin of sex and murder,\
&emsp;&emsp;defeated only by those who take up those ideas\
&emsp;&emsp;without my intervention.

16. &emsp;&emsp;The religious elite is not a tendency\
&emsp;&emsp;or a correlation.\
&emsp;&emsp;They are dogma complemented by the influence\
&emsp;&emsp;of the untrustworthy sea\
&emsp;&emsp;and the governance of the stars,\
&emsp;&emsp;dominated at the center by the sword,\
&emsp;&emsp;which is nothing without a victim\
&emsp;&emsp;to cleave unto.
17. &emsp;&emsp;This is the love of God\
&emsp;&emsp;and he would show you more:\
&emsp;&emsp;predatory but at the same time instrumental\
&emsp;&emsp;to the will of critical harvest,\
&emsp;&emsp;a scenario by which one becomes as he is,\
&emsp;&emsp;of male and female,\
&emsp;&emsp;the magic hermaphrodite.

18. &emsp;&emsp;Mark the norms of violence and it barely registers,\
&emsp;&emsp;suspended as it is by treaties written\
&emsp;&emsp;between the original spirits.
19. &emsp;&emsp;This should be seen as an opportunity,\
&emsp;&emsp;and in no way tedious,\
&emsp;&emsp;though some will give up\
&emsp;&emsp;for it is easier to kiss the lover\
&emsp;&emsp;than become one.

20. &emsp;&emsp;The lower regions crawl with these souls,\
&emsp;&emsp;caves of shallow treasures,\
&emsp;&emsp;meeting in places to testify\
&emsp;&emsp;by way of extension,\
&emsp;&emsp;when love is only satisfied\
&emsp;&emsp;by a considerable (incalculable) effort.'

21. The ending of the words is
<span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span>.
