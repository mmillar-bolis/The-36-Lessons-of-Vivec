## Chapter Thirty-Two

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Thirty-Two</span>

1. The Scripture of the Mace,\
\
First:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The pleasure of annihilation\
&emsp;&emsp;is the pleasure of disappearing into the unreal.
2. &emsp;&emsp;All those that would challenge the sleeping world\
&emsp;&emsp;will seek membership in this movement.\
&emsp;&emsp;I denounce the alienation of the Cloven Duality\
&emsp;&emsp;with a hammer.'

3. Second:\
&emsp;&emsp;'Take from me the lessons\
&emsp;&emsp;as a punishment for being mortal.\
&emsp;&emsp;To be made of dirt\
&emsp;&emsp;is to be treated as such\
&emsp;&emsp;by your jailers.
4. &emsp;&emsp;This is the key and the lock of the Daedra.\
&emsp;&emsp;Why do you think they escaped the compromise?'

5. Third:\
&emsp;&emsp;'Velothi, your skin\
&emsp;&emsp;has become the pregnant darkness.\
&emsp;&emsp;My brooding has brought this on.
6. &emsp;&emsp;Remember that Boethiah asked you\
&emsp;&emsp;to become the color of bruise.\
&emsp;&emsp;How else to show yourselves\
&emsp;&emsp;people of the exodus\
&emsp;&emsp;into the vital: pain?'

7. Fourth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The sage who is not an anvil:\
&emsp;&emsp;a conventional sentence and nothing more.\
&emsp;&emsp;By which I mean dead,\
&emsp;&emsp;the fourth walking way.'

8. Fifth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'A proper comprehension of the virtues:\
&emsp;&emsp;stage-managed and to be murdered.'

9. Sixth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'In the end, rejoice as a hostage\
&emsp;&emsp;released from drumming torment\
&emsp;&emsp;but that savors his wound.
10. &emsp;&emsp;The drum breaks\
&emsp;&emsp;and you find it to be a nest of hornets,\
&emsp;&emsp;which is to say: your sleep is over.'

11. Seventh:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The suspicious is spectacle\
&emsp;&emsp;and the lie is only a theoretical inspiration.'

12. Eighth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'But then why, you ask,\
&emsp;&emsp;do the Daedra wish to meddle\
&emsp;&emsp;with the Aurbis?\
&emsp;&emsp;It is because they are the radical critique,\
&emsp;&emsp;essential as all martyrs.
13. &emsp;&emsp;That some are more evil than others\
&emsp;&emsp;is not an illusion.\
&emsp;&emsp;Or rather, it is a necessary illusion.'

14. The ending of the words is
<span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span>.
