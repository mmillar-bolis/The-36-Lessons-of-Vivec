## Chapter Fifteen

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Fifteen</span>

1. These were the days of Resdaynia, when Chimer and Dwemer lived under the wise and benevolent rule of the <span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span> and their champion the Hortator.
2. When the gods of Veloth would retreat unto their own, to mold the cosmos and other matters, the Hortator would at times become confused.
3. Vivec would always be there to advise him, and this is the third of the three lessons of ruling kings:

4. &emsp;&emsp;'The ruling king will remove me, his maker.\
&emsp;&emsp;This is the way of all children.\
&emsp;&emsp;His greatest enemy is the Sharmat,\
&emsp;&emsp;who is the false dreamer.
5. &emsp;&emsp;You or he is the shingle, Hortator.\
&emsp;&emsp;Beware the wrong walking path.\
&emsp;&emsp;Beware the crime of benevolence.\
&emsp;&emsp;Behold him by his words.'

6. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I AM THE
<span style="color:red">SHARMAT</span>\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I AM OLDER THAN MUSIC\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;WHAT I BRING IS LIGHT\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;WHAT I BRING IS A STAR

7. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;WHAT I BRING IS\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;AN ANCIENT SEA\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;WHEN YOU SLEEP YOU SEE ME\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;DANCING AT THE CORE

8. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;IT IS NOT A BLIGHT\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;IT IS MY HOUSE\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I PUT A STAR\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;INTO THE WORLD'S MOUTH\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;TO MURDER IT

9. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;TEAR DOWN THE PYLONS\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;MY BLIND FISH\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;SWIM IN THE NEW\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;PHLOGISTON

10. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;TEAR DOWN THE PYLONS\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;MY DEAF MOONS\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;SING AND BURN\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;AND ORBIT ME

11. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I AM OLDER THAN MUSIC\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;WHAT I BRING IS LIGHT\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;WHAT I BRING IS A STAR\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;WHAT I BRING IS\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;AN ANCIENT SEA

12. &emsp;&emsp;'You alone,\
&emsp;&emsp;though you come again and again,\
&emsp;&emsp;can unmake him.\
&emsp;&emsp;Whether I allow it is within my wisdom.
13. &emsp;&emsp;Go unarmed into his den with these words of power:\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style="color:red">AE GHARTOK PADHOME</span>
\[<span style="color:red">CHIM</span>\]
<span style="color:red">AE ALTADOON</span>.\
&emsp;&emsp;Or do not.
14. &emsp;&emsp;The temporal myth is man.\
&emsp;&emsp;Reach heaven by violence.\
&emsp;&emsp;This magic I give to you:
15. &emsp;&emsp;the world you will rule\
&emsp;&emsp;is only an intermittent hope\
&emsp;&emsp;and you must be the letter\
&emsp;&emsp;written in uncertainty.'

16. &emsp;&emsp;The ending of the words is
<span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span>.
