## Chapter Twenty-Five

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Twenty-Five</span>

1. The Scripture of the City:\
\
&emsp;&emsp;'All cities are born of solid light.\
&emsp;&emsp;Such is my city, his city.

2. &emsp;&emsp;'But then the light subsides,\
&emsp;&emsp;revealing the bright and terrible angel of Veloth.
3. &emsp;&emsp;He is in his pre-chimerical form,\
&emsp;&emsp;demonic
<span style="color:red">VEHK</span>,
gaunt and pale and beautiful,\
&emsp;&emsp;skin stretched painfully thin on bird's bones,\
&emsp;&emsp;feathered serpents encircling his arms.
4. &emsp;&emsp;His wings are spread out behind him,\
&emsp;&emsp;their red and yellow ends like razors in the sun.
5. &emsp;&emsp;The wispy mass of his fire hair floats as if underwater,\
&emsp;&emsp;milky in the nimbus of light that crowns his head.
6. &emsp;&emsp;His presence is undeniable, the awe too much to bear.'

7. &emsp;&emsp;'This is God's city, different from others.\
&emsp;&emsp;Cities from foreign countries put their denizens to sleep\
&emsp;&emsp;and walk to the star-wounded East to pay homage to me.
8. &emsp;&emsp;The capital of the northern men, crusty with eon's ice,\
&emsp;&emsp;bows before Vivec the city, me it together.'

9. &emsp;&emsp;'Self-thought streets rush through tunnel blood.\
&emsp;&emsp;I have rebuilt myself.\
&emsp;&emsp;Hyper eyed signposts along my traffic arm,\
&emsp;&emsp;soon to be an inner sea.
10. &emsp;&emsp;My body is crawling with all gathered to see me\
&emsp;&emsp;rising up like a monolithic instrument of pleasure.\
&emsp;&emsp;My spine is the main road to the city that I am.
11. &emsp;&emsp;Countless transactions are taking place\
&emsp;&emsp;in veins and catwalks and the roaming, roaming, roaming,\
&emsp;&emsp;as they roam over and through and add to me.
12. &emsp;&emsp;There are temples erected along the hollow of my skull\
&emsp;&emsp;and I will ever wear them as a crown.\
&emsp;&emsp;Walk across the lips of God.'

13. &emsp;&emsp;'They add new doors to me\
&emsp;&emsp;and I become effortlessly trans-immortal\
&emsp;&emsp;with the comings and goings\
&emsp;&emsp;and the stride-heat of the market\
&emsp;&emsp;where I am traded for,
14. &emsp;&emsp;yell of the children hear them play,\
&emsp;&emsp;scoffed at, amused, desired, paid for in native coin,\
&emsp;&emsp;new minted with my face on one side\
&emsp;&emsp;and my city-body on the other.
15. &emsp;&emsp;I stare with each new window.\
&emsp;&emsp;Soon I am a million-eyed insect dreaming.'

16. &emsp;&emsp;'Red-sparking war trumpets sound\
&emsp;&emsp;like cattle in the ribcage of shuffling transit.\
&emsp;&emsp;The heretics are destroyed on the plaza knees.
17. &emsp;&emsp;I flood over into the hills,\
&emsp;&emsp;houses rising like a rash,\
&emsp;&emsp;and I never scratch.\
&emsp;&emsp;Cities are the antidotes to hunting.'

18. &emsp;&emsp;'I raise lanterns to light my hollows,\
&emsp;&emsp;lend wax to the thousands of candlesticks\
&emsp;&emsp;that bear my name again and again,
19. &emsp;&emsp;the name innumerable, shutting in,\
&emsp;&emsp;mantra and priest, god-city,\
&emsp;&emsp;filling every corner with the naming name,
20. &emsp;&emsp;wheeled, circling, running river language\
&emsp;&emsp;giggling with footfalls mating,\
&emsp;&emsp;selling, stealing, searching,\
&emsp;&emsp;and worry not ye who walk with me.
21. &emsp;&emsp;This is the flowering scheme of the Aurbis.\
&emsp;&emsp;This is the promise of the
<span style="color:red">PSJJJJ</span>:\
&emsp;&emsp;egg, image, man, god, city, state.
22. &emsp;&emsp;I serve and am served.\
&emsp;&emsp;I am made of wire and string and mortar\
&emsp;&emsp;and I accede my own precedent,\
&emsp;&emsp;world without am.'

23. The ending of the words is
<span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span>.
