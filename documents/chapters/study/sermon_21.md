## Chapter Twenty-One

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Twenty-One</span>

1. The Scripture of the Wheel,\
\
First:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The Spokes are the eight components of chaos,\
&emsp;&emsp;as yet solidified by the law of time:
2. &emsp;&emsp;static change, if you will,\
&emsp;&emsp;something the lizard gods refer to\
&emsp;&emsp;as the Striking.
3. &emsp;&emsp;That is the reptile wheel,\
&emsp;&emsp;coiled potential,\
&emsp;&emsp;ever-preamble to the never-action.'

4. Second:\
&emsp;&emsp;'They are the lent bones of the Aedra,\
&emsp;&emsp;the Eight gift-limbs to
<span style="color:red">SITHISIT</span>,\
&emsp;&emsp;the wet earth of the new star our home.
5. &emsp;&emsp;Outside them is the Aurbis,\
&emsp;&emsp;and not within.\
&emsp;&emsp;Like most things inexplicable,\
&emsp;&emsp;it is a circle.
6. &emsp;&emsp;Circles are confused serpents,\
&emsp;&emsp;striking and striking\
&emsp;&emsp;and never given leave to bite.
7. &emsp;&emsp;The Aedra would have you believe different,\
&emsp;&emsp;but they were givers before liars.\
&emsp;&emsp;Lies have turned them into biters.
8. &emsp;&emsp;Their teeth are the proselytizers;\
&emsp;&emsp;to convert is to place oneself\
&emsp;&emsp;in the mouth of falsehood;\
&emsp;&emsp;even to propitiate\
&emsp;&emsp;is to be swallowed.'

9. Third:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The enlightened are those uneaten by the world.'

10. Fourth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The spaces between the gift-limbs number sixteen,\
&emsp;&emsp;the signal shapes of the Demon Princedoms.\
&emsp;&emsp;It is the key and the lock,\
&emsp;&emsp;series and manticore.'

11. Fifth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'Look at the majesty sideways\
&emsp;&emsp;and all you see is the Tower,\
&emsp;&emsp;which our ancestors made idols from.
12. &emsp;&emsp;Look at its center\
&emsp;&emsp;and all you see is the begotten hole,\
&emsp;&emsp;second serpent,\
&emsp;&emsp;womb-ready for the Right Reaching,\
&emsp;&emsp;exact and without enchantment.'

13. Sixth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The heart of the second serpent\
&emsp;&emsp;holds the secret triangular gate.'

14. Seventh:\
&emsp;&emsp;'Look at the secret triangular gate sideways\
&emsp;&emsp;and you see the secret Tower.'

15. Eighth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The secret Tower within the Tower\
&emsp;&emsp;is the shape of the only name of God,\
&emsp;&emsp;I.'

16. The ending of the words is
<span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span>.
