## Chapter Twenty-Seven

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Twenty-Seven</span>

1. The Scripture of the Word,\
\
First:\
&emsp;&emsp;'All language is based on meat.\
&emsp;&emsp;Do not let the sophists fool you.'

2. Second:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The third walking path explores hysteria without fear.\
&emsp;&emsp;The efforts of madmen are a society of itself,\
&emsp;&emsp;but only if they are written.
3. &emsp;&emsp;The wise may substitute one law for another,\
&emsp;&emsp;even into incoherence,\
&emsp;&emsp;and still say he is working within a method.\
&emsp;&emsp;This is true of speech and extends to all scripture.'

4. Third:\
&emsp;&emsp;'Do not go to the realm of apology for absolution.\
&emsp;&emsp;Beyond articulation, there is no fault.
5. &emsp;&emsp;The Adjacent Place, where the Grabbers live,\
&emsp;&emsp;is the illusion of the vocal\
&emsp;&emsp;or the middle realms of thought,\
&emsp;&emsp;by which I mean the constructed.
6. &emsp;&emsp;This is how I stole the certainty\
&emsp;&emsp;of the Chancellor of Exactitude,\
&emsp;&emsp;perfect to look upon from every angle.
7. &emsp;&emsp;When you come out of the vocal,\
&emsp;&emsp;you can never be certain.'

8. Fourth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The truest body of work is made up of silence:\
&emsp;&emsp;as in the silence that results from no reference.\
&emsp;&emsp;By the word I mean the dead.'

9. Fifth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The first meaning is always hidden.'

10. Sixth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The realm of apology is perfection\
&emsp;&emsp;and impossible to attack.\
&emsp;&emsp;Thus, the wise avoid it.
11. &emsp;&emsp;Trinity in unity is the world\
&emsp;&emsp;and word of action:\
&emsp;&emsp;the third walking path.'

12. Seventh:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The sage who suppresses his best aphorism:\
&emsp;&emsp;cut off his hands, for he is a thief.'

13. Eighth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The clothes of the broken map are worn\
&emsp;&emsp;only by fools and heretics.\
&emsp;&emsp;The map is an exit for laziness.
14. &emsp;&emsp;It is the dusty tongue,\
&emsp;&emsp;which is to say the given chart\
&emsp;&emsp;that most take as a story that is complete.\
&emsp;&emsp;No word is true until it is eaten.'

15. The ending of the words is
<span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span>.
