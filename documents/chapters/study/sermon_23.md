## Chapter Twenty-Three

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Twenty-Three</span>

1. The Scripture of the Sword,\
\
First:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The sword, treated as a delicate meal,\
&emsp;&emsp;is the Symbolic Collage.\
&emsp;&emsp;It serves you well in the first half of life.\
&emsp;&emsp;Name one dynasty that knows this not.'

2. Second:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The unity of my approach\
&emsp;&emsp;is understood by the immobile warrior.\
&emsp;&emsp;True eyes are acquired.
3. &emsp;&emsp;Rejoice as my own subjects and realms.\
&emsp;&emsp;I build for you a city of swords,\
&emsp;&emsp;by which I mean laws\
&emsp;&emsp;that cut the people who live there\
&emsp;&emsp;into better shapes.'

4. Third:\
&emsp;&emsp;'Girls burn their dresses on my arrival\
&emsp;&emsp;if I am armored.\
&emsp;&emsp;They crawl to me as bled pilgrims.
5. &emsp;&emsp;Minor spirits die without trace.\
&emsp;&emsp;Follow me of all the
<span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span>\
&emsp;&emsp;if you are to mark your days\
&emsp;&emsp;with killing.
6. &emsp;&emsp;<span style="color:red">AE ALTADOON</span>,\
&emsp;&emsp;the third law of weaponry.'

7. Fourth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The immobile warrior is never fatigued.\
&emsp;&emsp;He cuts sleep holes in the middle of a battle\
&emsp;&emsp;to regain his strength.'

8. Fifth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'Instinct is not reflex action,\
&emsp;&emsp;but mini-miracles held in reserve.
9. &emsp;&emsp;I am the welfare that decides\
&emsp;&emsp;which warrior will emerge.\
&emsp;&emsp;Beg not for luck.\
&emsp;&emsp;Serve me to win.'

10. Sixth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The span of the apparently inactivated\
&emsp;&emsp;is your love of the absolute.\
&emsp;&emsp;The birth of God from the netchiman's wife\
&emsp;&emsp;is the abortion of kindness from love.'

11. Seventh:\
&emsp;&emsp;'The true sword is able to cut chains of generations,\
&emsp;&emsp;which is to say, the creation myths of your enemies.\
&emsp;&emsp;Look on me as the exiled garden.\
&emsp;&emsp;All else is uncut weed.'

12. Eighth:\
&emsp;&emsp;'I give you an ancient road\
&emsp;&emsp;tempered by the second walking way.
13. &emsp;&emsp;Your hands must be huge to wield any sword\
&emsp;&emsp;the size of an ancient road,\
&emsp;&emsp;and yet he who is of right stature\
&emsp;&emsp;may irritate the sun with only a stick.'

14. The ending of the words is
<span style="color:red">ALMSIVI</span>.
