# Traditional Edition Changes

The [Traditional Edition][1] is based directly on dumps of *TES III: Morrowind*'s text. It also reintroduces the indentation system seen in the early versions of [Sermon One][2], [Sermon Two][3], and [The Imperial Library][4], before and during the time that *TES III* came out.

Listed below are the edits I made. In total, only 15 words have been changed. Four of those are the same misspelled word (*AMLSIVI*, likely the result of a copy error), three of them are merely compactions (*major domo*), and one was a missing letter (*PSJJJ*). Only one noun was changed (*Narsis*) and one word was removed (a leftover *to*). There were only eleven punctuation changes, all within Sermon 11, curiously enough.

## Further Explanation

Initially, the UESP Wiki served as the basis of my editions. Historically, it has been the resource for much of my Morrowind related references. Generally, it remains a primary and influential source alongside [the Imperial Library][18]. The UESP features multiple versions of the Lessons to account for any changes between games. I opted to use the [Morrowind page][19] version; my original intent was to avoid any differences between the original game's text and TES:Online, including the deuterocanonical [thirty-seventh chapter][20] and [sermon zero][21]. Unfortunately, I later found out that all game-specific versions of text on that site are sourced from the lore page version; the text bodies are not actually entirely separate.

As I went further through my editing process, I had discovered that there were indeed small textual errors in UESP's versions that were not present in the Imperial Library ones. Such changes would seem small to most, but in a couple of cases constituted a restructuring to the formatting. For example in Sermon Eight on the UESP, the following sequence, at the time of my collection, was rendered thusly:

> Ayem said to Nerevar:
>
> 'Seht who is Azura....

Note the colon and the dropping of the quotation to the next line. I had not carefully checked for these formatting changes until late into editing, but here is how the game renderes the text:

> Ayem said to Nerevar, 'Seht who is Azura...

No line difference. Sure, part of it is the hazardous nature of keeping a public Wiki clean. In places where spelling errors are present in the source material, UESP has made diligent efforts to preserve them and leave detailed notes. However, small formatting changes have managed to slip through, and in this case, every comma before a quote in this chapter was changed to a colon with a return.

I don't levy these as criticism of the Wiki. On the contrary, I find this to be more readable and am fascinated further by the fact that I too copied these errors before discovering them, under the false assumption that nothing had been changed. *Woops.* In any case, this appears to be an edit to the text that sprouted up naturally. Rest assured, I have already submitted my corrections to the wiki before posting this write-up.

Another observation I made on formatting was the difference between the sermons posted online *before* the release of the game, as opposed to the slightly different way they were structured for the game. Undoubtedly, each sermon in the dense and cramped pages of the in-game tomes received it's respective layout primarily due to interface and resolution constraints. *However*, the versions of these texts that were posted to Bethesda's forums, and subsequently [redistributed][22] on websites during the months prior to the game's release, feature indentations to some sections within the body. The earliest complete copy of the structured web version of the text that I could find dates to somewhere around [January, 2003][23].

Again, this is a revelation that might seem trivial to most. However, regardless of the reason, I found it interesting to see that the Imperial Library and UESP, at some point in the ten years after Morrowind, went away from indenting those sections of text, making the format effectively dead.

[At the time that I sampled][24] UESP's copy of *Sermon 10*, the following passage was layed out like so:

> ...or, better, in the skin of his enemies.
>
> "The eyelid of the kingdom shall fill thiry\[sic\] and six folios, but the eye shall read the world."
>
> By this the Hortator needs me to understand. The sword is an impatient signature. Write no contacts on...

Note that after the quotation, the next sentence falls to the proceeding line. However, in the game, it is rendered thusly:

> ...or, better, in the skin of his enemies.
>
> "The eyelid of the kingdom shall fill thirty and six folios, but the eye shall read the world." By this the Hortator needs me to understand.
>
> The sword is an impatient signature. Write no contacts on...

Once again, in the old web versions this passage appears with another lost stylistic change: indentations. See below:

> ...or, better, in the skin of his enemies.
>
> <span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"The eyelid of the kingdom shall fill thirty and six folios, but the eye shall read the world." By this the Hortator needs me to understand.</span>
>
> The sword is an impatient signature. Write no contacts on...

I found these variations worthy of mention because each version *could* lead to slight differences in tone and interpretation. Does the phrase, *'By this the Hortator needs me to understand'* book-end the quotation? Does it lead into the next paragraph? Is it meant to start it? How is one idea jumping off into another? Indentation could likewise be considered an important factor in presentation and emphasis which is why I thought to preserve it in the *Traditional Edition*.

In the end, I found enough deviations in the wiki to warrant going back and rebasing the *entire* text on a dump I made of the game's resources. As stated, I submitted my corrections to UESP as well, so where it's possible their version *should* now match that of the games.

## Red Letter Edition

Another major influence on the Lessons is the [Bhagavad Gita][55], and [Indian epics][56] in general. The Dunmeri language as written in the Daedric script also bears a strong resemblance to [Sanskrit][57], especially in following the stylings of some [ancient manuscripts][58]. It's been a [historic practice][59] to write headings, [colophons][60], and annotations in red, to distinguish commentary and headings that surround the body of text.

In some Vedic and Jainist manuscripts, it has also [been observed][61] that alternative colors, especially red, were used to highlight [important phrases][62] or [symbols][63] for the reader. In general, highlighted sections or words in red are called [rubrics][64], from the Latin word *rubrica* which means *red ochre,* the crushed clay that was used to make the particular ink. In medieval Europe, there even came to be an official process for adding red to manuscripts, called [rubrication][65].

The rubrication process was a matter of discipline that belonged to [scriptoria][66], the preparation of manuscripts for codex production. Initially similar to modern italics, red highlighting was often used for headings and emphasis within these manuscripts. In [Christian liturgies][67], such as during the Liturgy of the Eucharist in the Catholic Mass, the [Words of Consecration][68], often called the Dominical Institution, are stated by the priest as part of a sacrament of bread and wine. While it continues to be the practice to rubricate these words in missals, the practice did not make the jump to the Christian Bible until around 1900.

Because there were no quotation marks in any of the historic manuscripts, they were not present in the initial English versions of the Bible either. In an attempt to add emphasis, but also to differentiate from the ambiguously surrounding text, [Louis Klopsch][69] applied rubrication to the words among the four Gospels that are understood to have been literally spoken by Jesus Christ, referred to as the Dominical Words. Klopsch's rubricated New Testament, called the [Red Letter Edition][70] was first published in 1899.
