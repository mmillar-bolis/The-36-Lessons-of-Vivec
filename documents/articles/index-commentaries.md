#### Description:

Below are the commentaries I have come across during my research on the Lessons. As an obscure subject, there is not a whole lot of material out there, but what does exist is quite insightful.

The very first work resembling a commentary was written by Vsevolod Alekseyev, who took over [Xanathar's Library][1] under the username [*Qwerty*][2]. The earliest available archive is from [2001-12][3], and for a long time, only the first chapter had been completed. Some time after the Library had changed web hosts, an expanded set of commentary with a new preface had surfaced. The earliest extant version is currently from [2004-02][4].

The next commentary I have come across was published in [2011-01][5] by Tante Lien, who covered ten chapters. Around [2012-03][6], Jerome Barry IV began a series of lengthy essays on the sermons, but abruptly stopped after chapter six. *Ronenum* began a similar endeavor with the first three chapters, in [2014-02][7]. Another short commentary of a select three chapters was made available by user *jclark28* in [2016-06][8].

In [2018-03][9], user *DapperBlues* published a commentary, but also stopped after the first chapter. Another incomplete set of annotations was started in [2019-02][10] by the commentator Kendra. In [2020-01][11], user *Vukov_Intrigued* published the beginnings of a dual-language edition of the Lessons with part-by-part commentary and synopses.

Last, but certainly not least there is the [New Whirling School][12] commentary by [*Rotten Deadite*][13], with input from *BuckneyBos*. It is ongoing still but already the longest work of its kind. With intent to finish the remaining chapters, their exegesis will likely be the *first* complete set of commentaries.
