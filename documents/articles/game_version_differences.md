# Text Game Version Differences

During the course of this project, I discovered many discrepancies between the original version of *The 36 Lessons* and the version found in *TES: Online*,. Not only are there some interesting differences between the two, but *Online*'s edition is actually *taken* from the UESP, spelling errors and all! My textual research is especially based on the following game versions:

|                Game | Version    |
|--------------------:|:-----------|
| __TES3: Morrowind__ | 1.6.0.1820 |
|     __TES: Online__ | 8.2.8      |

## One and One: Two Inelegant Versions

The original text from *TES3: Morrowind* has a few [minor mistakes and spelling errors][1] that are largely corrected in *TES: Online*'s edition of the *36 Lessons*, with a few exceptions such as *Sermon 34*'s mention of Narsis instead of Necrom.

[1]: traditional_version_changes.md

Further, *TES: Online*'s version modifies a lot of punctuation including changing commas to colons, single quotes to double, and double hyphens to em dashes. It also fixes a few double spaces, removes a couple Oxford commas from *Sermon 3*, and adds or removes various commas here and there.

Another thing *TES: Online*'s version changes is the structure of a few passages in sermons 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10. Some examples:

__Sermon 1__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;...until they were like stars or the messages of stars. Ayem took a netchiman's wife and said:
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;...until they were like stars or the messages of stars.
>
> &emsp;Ayem took a netchiman's wife and said:

__Sermon 1__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;...or the Multiplier of Motions Known. And Fa-Nuit-Hen said:
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;...or the Multiplier of Motions Known.
>
> &emsp;And Fa-Nuit-Hen said:

__Sermon 2__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;bowing to the five corners of the world and saying: 'Thus whoever performs this holy act shall be proud and mighty among the rest!'
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;bowing to the five corners of the world and saying:
>
> &emsp;"Thus whoever performs this holy act shall be proud and mighty among the rest!"

When the prelude to a quotation is on the same line as the rest of a paragraph in the *TES3* edition, it is moved down to it's own line in the *TES: Online* edition. The same treatment is given to quotations themselves if they were on the same line (with the exception of a passage in Sermon 8).

In a few places among these particular chapters, longer paragraphs have been broken out into shorter ones.

__Sermon 2__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;...when the earth still cooled, and was not blinded. It joined with the Daedroth and took its former secrets,
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;...when the earth still cooled, and was not blinded.
>
> &emsp;It joined with the Daedroth and took its former secrets,

__Sermon 3__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;The egg said: 'Love is used not only as... and looks that linger too long. Love is also an often-used ingredient...

> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;The egg said:
>
> &emsp;"Love is used not only as... and looks that linger too long.
>
> &emsp;"Love is also an often-used ingredient...

## Ghartok Padhome: A New Round of Changes

*TES: Online* introduces it's own set of misspellings and errors.

__Sermon 5__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;...was broken and empty. A `Chimeri` warrior,
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;...was broken and empty. A `Chimer` warrior,

In the *TES: Online* edition, approximately seven lines below this, the word `Chimeri` is still used, as well as in all other chapters where the word originally occurred.

__Sermon 8__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;Ayem said, 'AYEM AE SEHTI `AE` VEHK.
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;Ayem said:
>
> &emsp;"AYEM AE SEHTI `AH` VEHK.

__Sermon 8__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;...gilled and blended in all the arts of the `star-wounded` East,
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;...gilled and blended in all the arts of the `starwounded` East,

For comparison, in *TES: Online*'s edition, this same phrase found in sermons 18 and 25 is still rendered  `star-wounded`.

__Sermon 10__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;The sword is an impatient signature. Write no `contracts` on the dead.
>
> &emsp;Vivec says unto the Hortator remember the words of Boet-hi-ah:
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;The sword is an impatient signature. Write no `contacts` on the dead. Vivec says unto the Hortator remember the words of Boet-hi-ah:

__Sermon 10__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;again like the enemy Corners of the `House` of Troubles,
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;again like the enemy Corners of the `house` of Troubles,

__Sermon 11__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;The ending of the words is ALMSIVI`.`
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;The ending of the words is ALMSIVI

__Sermon 13__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;...when Chimer and Dwemer lived under the `wise and` benevolent rule of the AMLSIVI
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;...when Chimer and Dwemer lived under the benevolent rule of the ALMSIVI

For comparison, in *TES: Online*'s edition, this same passage found in sermons 11, 15, 17, and 36 still contains `wise and`.

__Sermon 24__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;...and make of it a conduit to the full concentrate of the ALMSIVI.`'`
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;...and make of it a conduit to the full concentrate of the ALMSIVI.

## Roleplaying an Amateur Philologist

As I went through the two versions, comparing them line by line with diffing tools, I was expecting some textual restructuring. I was expecting some spelling errors. However, I was not expecting to find redactions or edits that altered the potential meaning of entire passages.

__Sermon 5__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;But another Chimer, who was wise in the ways of prophecy, looked on the simulacrum with disquietude.
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;But another Chimer, who was wise in the ways of `the` prophecy, looked on the simulacrum with disquietude.

__Sermon 6__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;...and they will test you until you have the proper tendencies of `the` hero.
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;...and they will test you until you have the proper tendencies of `a` hero.

These first two are ather minor and while it could be argued that Sermon 6's passage is ambiguous enough to retain it's point, Sermon 5's update now seems to suggest that the other Chimer was wise in a *particular* prophecy, as opposed to the subject in general.

However, and as mentioned, the most exciting discovery in *TES: Online*'s version of the text was a curious redaction, and the only one of it's kind:

__Sermon 11__
> __TES3: Morrowind:__\
> &emsp;Do not abuse your powers or they will lead you astray. `They will leave you like rebellious daughters. They will lose their virtue.` They will become lost and resentful and finally become pregnant with the seed of folly.
>
> __TES: Online:__\
> &emsp;Do not abuse your powers or they will lead you astray. They will become lost and resentful and finally become pregnant with the seed of folly.

For several months, it remained an enigma to me as to why this passage was removed. It seems easy to conclude that censorship was the reason, but why leave the following sentence mentioning pregnancy? Why only this passage and not any others? I couldn't say for certain.

## A Separate Textual Tradition

One reddit.com user, Barilla3113, proposed a theory that many of the books for *TES: Online* have been imported from community sources as opposed to Bethesda themselves. He may be correct after all: the source that ZeniMax Online may have been using for *The 36 Lessons* is quite probably the [UESP's version prior to 2019][2].

I was cleaning up a personal copy of [Tante Lien's Commentary][3] when I noticed that the version the user was quoting from, all the way back in 2011, contained many of the same differences later found in *TES: Online*, especially the passage in *Sermon 6*:

__Quote from Tante Lien's Commentary:__
> ...and they will test you until you have the proper tendencies of `a` hero.

I searched around and [RottenDeadite][4] posted a remarkably similar rendering of this chapter to [reddit.com][5] that is dated around 2014, close to the launch of *TES: Online*. While it is *possible* that Deadite dumped the text himself merely months after *Online* was released, I just couldn't be too sure so I continued to research.

On the UESP, I believe that the main collection of chapters for the *36 Lessons* is actually an aggregate of each chapter's individual pages. Looking at the [Lore Version history][6] and the [Morrowind Version history][7] reveals several gaps in historic changes that I could not find except on [archive.org][8].

*However*, when I went to the individual [history page for *Sermon 6*][9], I was able to discover that the change to this passage extends [all the way back to 2006][10]. It appears that I was the one to fix it in 2021.

Here is [the UESP history page for *Sermon 11*][11]. The "rebellious daughters" passage is missing from 2006 until it was reinserted in 2019.

Here is [the UESP history page for *Sermon 13*][12]. The missing "wise and" isn't reinserted until 2021.

Here is [the UESP history page for *Sermon 5*][13]. "Chimer" isn't restored to "Chimeri" until I contributed the fix in 2021. Likewise with the erroneous, extra "the" in "the ways of *the* prophecy".

Here is [the UESP history page for *Sermon 8*][14]. "AH VEHK" was not fixed until 2019. "Starwounded" doesn't have it's hyphen restored until 2021.

Here is [the UESP history page for *Sermon 10*][15]. "Contacts" is not corrected to "contracts" until 2021.

Barilla3113's belief that ZeniMax Online was copying and pasting books into *TES: Online* appears to be correct, and the source they have been using&mdash;at least for the *36 Lessons*&mdash;may not come from an internal document at all, but from the Textus Receptus of the UESP.

## A Tiny New Change

The `9.0.5` update to *TES:Online* produced another minor change to the text, probably by way of some mass word correction.

__Sermon 7, TES:O 8.2.8__
> there came great rumblings from the oblivion. A duke among `scamps` wandered into the House of Troubles.

__Sermon 7, TES:O 9.0.5__
> there came great rumblings from the oblivion. A duke among `Scamps` wandered into the House of Troubles.
